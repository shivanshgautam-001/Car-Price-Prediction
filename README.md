# Car Price Prediction Model

## Introduction

This documentation presents a project aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features of the cars. The project utilizes a dataset comprising various car attributes to train multiple regression models. The ultimate goal is to accurately predict the prices of cars based on these features.

## About

**Car Prices:** The price of a car is influenced by various factors including make, model, year of manufacture, engine size, fuel type, mileage, and additional features. Predicting car prices accurately is crucial for buyers, sellers, and insurance companies to make informed decisions.

## Relation of Car Features and Price

The price of a car is determined by multiple attributes that can be broadly categorized into intrinsic features (like make, model, and engine size) and usage-based features (like mileage and year of manufacture). Additional factors like the car's condition, market trends, and economic conditions also play a significant role in determining the price. By analyzing these features, machine learning models can predict car prices with a good degree of accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing

Upon loading the dataset, relevant features are extracted and categorized into intrinsic features and usage-based features. Features are then preprocessed which may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features using techniques like StandardScaler.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Multiple regression algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data, including:

- *Linear Regression*
- *Decision Tree Regressor*
- *Random Forest Regressor*
- *Gradient Boosting Regressor*
- *Support Vector Regressor (SVR)*
- *Voting Regressor*

The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as training and testing accuracy scores.

## Machine Learning Model Overview

- **Linear Regression:** A simple and widely used regression technique that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It provides a straightforward and interpretable baseline for comparison.

- **Decision Tree Regressor:** A tree-based model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions. It is easy to understand and interpret, but it can be prone to overfitting without proper tuning.

- **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and merges their results to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. It is robust and handles non-linear relationships well.

- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** An advanced ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, where each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous ones. Known for its high accuracy, it combines the strengths of many weak models to form a strong predictive model.

- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR):** A regression method that aims to find the hyperplane that best fits the data by balancing the margin around it. It is effective for high-dimensional spaces and when there is a clear margin of separation.

- **Voting Regressor:** An ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions from multiple different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and SVR). The final prediction is made based on the average of the individual models' predictions, which often improves overall performance.

## Model Comparison

The accuracies and performance metrics of different models are compared and presented in a tabular format, sorted in descending order of performance metrics like R-squared score.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive demonstration of utilizing machine learning for car price prediction. It incorporates diverse features and multiple regression algorithms to enhance accuracy and reliability. The predictive models developed in this project have the potential to assist car buyers, sellers, and insurance companies in making informed decisions regarding car pricing, enabling fair transactions and proper valuation.
